# Changelog - 2026-02-12

## Summary
Project tree reorganization: consolidated documentation into `doc/`, archived obsolete files, restructured tests, and cleaned up parasitic files from root. Added Jest/ts-jest unit tests for `utils.ts` (60 tests), `fieldMappings.ts` (20 tests), and n8n UI/integration tests (103 tests) covering node description, types, credentials, and loadOptions. Added automated n8n UI integration tests validating all 33 PrestaShop resources (List/GetById/Search) + CRUD operations + Display Custom via n8n REST API.

- [tests/unit/utils.test.ts] Created 60 unit tests covering all exported functions from `utils.ts`: extractPrestashopError, processSortParameter, processDisplayParameter, buildUrlWithFilters, buildCreateXml, buildUpdateXml, simplifyPrestashopResponse, processResponseForMode, parseXmlToJson, validateFieldsForCreate, validateDataForResource, REQUIRED_FIELDS_BY_RESOURCE
- [tests/unit/fieldMappings.test.ts] Created 20 unit tests covering all exports from `fieldMappings.ts`: convertFromCamelCase, getFieldMappingsForResource, CREATE_FIELD_MAPPINGS, CAMELCASE_TO_PRESTASHOP_MAPPINGS
- [tests/unit/.gitkeep] Removed placeholder file
- [tests/unit/PrestaShop8.node.test.ts] Created 42 tests validating n8n node description structure: required properties, resource selector (32 resources, alphabetical sort), operation field (loadOptionsMethod), ID/display/customFields visibility, advanced options, required CREATE fields (products/categories/customers/addresses/manufacturers), search filters (images vs others), options section (request/response/timeout)
- [tests/unit/types.test.ts] Created 37 tests for PRESTASHOP_RESOURCES (32 resources, IPrestaShopResource structure, limited capabilities for stock_availables/order_details/order_histories/configurations, full CRUD for all others) and FILTER_OPERATORS (12 operators with name/value)
- [tests/unit/credentials.test.ts] Created 8 tests for PrestaShop8Api credentials: name/displayName, 3 properties (baseUrl, apiKey with password, testConnection), generic auth with basic auth, test request on products endpoint
- [tests/unit/nodeLoadOptions.test.ts] Created 6 tests for loadOptions.getOperations: full CRUD (6 ops), stock_availables (4 ops), order_histories (4 ops), configurations (4 ops), unknown resource (empty), operation structure validation

- [tests/ui/run-integration-tests.py] Created automated integration test runner: logs into n8n REST API, executes List/GetById/Search for all 33 resources via workflow API, validates results (92/95 pass, 96.8% — 3 expected failures: tags empty, images special format, guests not implemented)
- [tests/ui/check-n8n-health.py] Created health check script: verifies n8n accessible, login works, PrestaShop 8 node loaded, credentials configured
- [tests/ui/ui-test-scenarios.ts] Created 33 resource test scenarios + 3 transversal scenarios (Display Custom, credential check, search filter), documenting capabilities and test data per resource
- [tests/ui/README.md] Created documentation for UI integration tests: prerequisites, quick start, configuration, resource coverage, troubleshooting
- [tests/ui/integration-test-results.json] Generated test results: 92 passed, 3 failed (expected), 4 skipped across 33 resources

- [nodes/PrestaShop8/resourceSchemas.ts] Add explicit `id` field conversion (string → number) in `convertResourceTypes()` so create/update responses return a numeric `id` consistent with list/getById/search
- [tests/unit/utils.test.ts] Add 3 unit tests for `convertResourceTypes` id field conversion (string→number, already number, any resource) + import `convertResourceTypes` from resourceSchemas

## Notes
No source code changes in first batch. Build and lint should be unaffected. Integration test failures are expected: tags (empty table), images (special ID format), guests (not a node resource).
